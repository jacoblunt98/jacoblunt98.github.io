            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up in Iowa does not come with a lot of perks. For one you have to know how to deal with the weather, the "people",
                and the lack of activities. Once you figure that out, there isn't much else to learn. Just wait till your 18 so you can 
                move to another state. Everyone does it. Before I get carried away, this is a little summary about my life growing up in 
                Iowa.

            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jacob Blunt and I was born and raised in Southern Iowa. I have 2 siblings and 4 pets. I am going to college and 
                am enrolled in the Interactive Media Program at Indian Hills Community College. I plan on going to a 4-year college after
                I graduate from IHCC. I am always trying to make myself a better person whether that is physically or mentally. 
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I have done quiet a lot in the time I have been on earth. I did baseball, football, swimming, gymnastics, and track. I use 
                to play the guitar and always wanted to play the drums when I was little. My current hobbies are listening to music, going
                to the gym, hanging out with friends, and shopping.
