            <h2>My Resume</h2>

            <h2>Work Force</h2>
            <p>
                I have had a total of 3 jobs since I was old enough to work. I started at Kohl's and worked there for about 2 months. It
                was a seasonal job so I did't expect to be there long. After that, I moved over to Menards. I worked there for about 2 years.
                During my time at Menards, I learned a lot of valuable skills. I learned great communication skills, a great work ethic, and
                I even learned how to operate a forklift. Now I currently work at Tractor Supply and it is my favorite of the 3. The people
                are nice, they have good hours, and good pay.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                During HighSchool, I matured a lot (as people do). I took a variety of class such as Cabinet Making, DC Circuit Analysis,
                Graphic Communications, and CAD (Computer Aid Drafting). This shows that I have experience in all of these fields.
