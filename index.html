            </h2>
            <p>
                This website is an "About Me" mixed with a resume I constructed. The "About Me" will go into what trials I faced
                along the way of becoming an adult along with basic information of who I am. This isn't just an boring "About Me" with a resume
                slapped on it. This shows you, yes you, who I am. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to ge to know me personally, you can visit the contact page and email or text me. I will also link my profile 
                which is located in blue down below.

            <h2>Why do it?</h2>
                <p>
                    The reason I do this is for the future. I can come back and edit this website anythime I want wether it is adding or remove
                    text, changing up the css, or adding new content in general such as a whole new page. This will give my employer and good
                    understanding of who I am and if I am a great fit for the company that I am trying to get into.
